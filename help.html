          <h3>Gather Resources</h3>
          <p>One way you can help is by gathering lots of resources. If we
            want to have better roads and more farms among other things,
            we must have lots of resources like cobblestone, stone, wood(all
            types except birch, because it's ugly), and more.

          <h3>Vote for me</h3>
          <p>If you vote for me as president, I will help everyone to make our republic a better place. I also have lots
            of ideas to make the discord server better. And I think I have almost found where the fortress is.</p>

        <div class="help-columns">
          <h3>Play more</h3>
          <p>We have the longer terms in the summer because usually we play more. However, this summer I feel like we have
            barely played on the server at all, so I am thinking that mabye we should have a regular time to play on the
            server every few weeks.</p>
